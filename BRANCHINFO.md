About the archive-org branch
============================

This branch contains the same info as the master branch, but also has 
some sparse data points from The Wayback Machine at archive.org. It's 
only a few, and it flattens out the graph. The early days of the 
repository database also doesn't represent the data accurately before 
the database was properly populated.

The master branch will be merged into this branch now and then, so it's 
not always bleeding edge. To merge the newest changes on master, execute 
`make merge-master`.
